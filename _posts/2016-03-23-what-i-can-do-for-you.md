As an experienced Civil 3D User, using only the latest and most up to date software, I am capable of delivering a well designed model for your project needs. This model would include a highly accurate surface model along with pipe network models for storm, waste water and/or water lines. 

With my experience, I can create drainage area maps and create basic calculations using the Rational/Modified Rational or SCS methods. I can grade your site to use storm sewer or sheet flow/concentrated pathways. I can create as detailed of a model as you require. I have worked on projects from as small as a single water line and hydrant installation, to as large as a high school football stadium.

It is my belief that the more accurate the model, the less likely there will be conflicts during the construction process. With this mind set, I will always begin with a surface model, provided by the surveyor. I will then examine it and do a rough grading pass for your review. From there, we will make changes, based on cut/fill quantities, changes in drainage patterns, or any other client driven requirements you may have. I will make a second pass at the grading, as well as a first pass at the utility alignment layouts. With your approval, I will then move on to laying out the profiles of the utilities per minimum municipal specification. 

Annotation and presentation will generally be your responsibility, unless you specifically request those services. If you require a specific set of layer and text standards, you should provide those upfront, otherwise I will use my own standards, which are based on the National CAD Standards. I am generally very quick and efficient, but I do my best to be as thorough as possible, especially when it comes to drainage and grading. 

My models can generally be data referenced into your own files and annotated with your own standards within Civil 3D. My deliverables are always a series of Autocad files (of the most current file version), along side a series of LandXML files containing the same data for import into your software of choice (should you not be using Civil 3D).

I can also provide technical support calls or on-site visits after normal business hours. I can setup and implement Civil 3D standards and walk you through the uses for each template file you would need.

My rates are generally based on an hourly basis, but we can review your project needs ahead of time, and possibly develop a lump sum amount for any larger contract work. Contact me directly for questions regarding fees and payments.
